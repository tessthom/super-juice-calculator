          <h2>What the heck is Super Juice?</h2>
          <p>
            A nearly shelf stable, wildly efficient technique for cocktail prep,
            Super Juice is made by combining citrus peels with powdered acids
            (citric, and depending on what recipe you're using, malic acid).
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            Letting these ingredients co-mingle for a while extracts the
            essential oils from the peels and forms a slurry called oleo
            citrate. Water is then blended quickly with the slurry and peels,
            incorporating all that good concentrated oil and acid. It gets fine
            strained to remove solids, then fresh juice from the peeled fruit is
            added to the mix.

          <h2>Who came up with all this?</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Super Juice was actual Kentucky colonel and owner of the Expo in
            Lexinton, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/handsomedagger/?hl=en">Nickle Morris</a>. He came up with the original recipe for
            "super juice" oleo citrate, which harnesses the power of the oils in
            citrus peels and is based in the same science as oleo saccharum. You
            may have heard of the latter, because it's been a thing in baking
            for a very long time.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            Nickle was inspired by the work of <a href="https://punchdrink.com/lookbook/dave-arnold-liquid-intelligence-co-owner-existing-conditions-nyc/">Dave Arnold</a>, author of the James Beard Award Winning book Liquid
            Intelligence and owner of Booker and Dax in New York City. Arnold
            has done a lot of work with acids and their effects on flavor in
            cocktails, and has a recipe for a similar product called "acid
            adjusted citrus juice" in his book.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            <a href="https://www.kevinkos.com/post/how-to-get-8x-as-much-juice-from-one-citrus" target="_blank">Kevin Kos</a>, a cocktail influencer, innovator and creator of a lot of
            popular online content, has a slightly different formula than Nickle
            Morris, and has been a big source of the technique's popularity.
            Whose recipe is the best depends on who you talk to, but they all
            work! The nuance is ultimately up to personal preference and what
            you're using it for.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            My calculator uses an amalgamation of Morris' and Kos' recipes,
            adjusted slightly in accordance with the most frequent takes shared
            by bartenders and bar owners that I respect in real life, and on
            Reddit. By sheer personal preference, I lean toward Morris' specs,
            so take that for what it's worth and adjust accordingly. I do hope
            to make the time to add the ability to adjust acid ratios before
            entering your weights into the calculator. I will add more fruits as
            well, but for now this project is about mobile-first design and core
            functionality. Thanks!

          <p class="indent">
            Super juice is exciting because it drastically reduces the
            tremendous amount of waste that many cocktail bars make in order to
            have quality, fresh citrus juice prepped for every service. As you
            may be aware, citrus juice, especially those that are more acidic
            and less sweet, starts degrading the instant it hits the air. This
            is called oxidation, and if you've never tested it yourself - know
            that fresh squeezed lime juice, for example, will taste markedly
            different in the first hour than it does in the 4th, or 7th, or
            24th.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            That's why any decent bar has to do so much citrus prep for every
            single shift. The product just doesn't taste the same the next day,
            so fresh citrus is the bare minimum standard. 
          </p>
          <p class="indent">The last craft
            cocktail bar that I worked at went through two 23-gallon trash cans
            of lime, lemon and orange carcasses per shift, Monday through
            Saturday. Super Juice not only cuts the quantity of fruit down
            tremendously, but because the end product maintains its flavor for a
            full week or two, you don't even need to prep juices every shift!</p>
